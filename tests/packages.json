        "notes": "# The Project \r\nA fine in the reign of King of England Henry III (1216\u20131272) was an agreement to pay the king a sum of money for a specified concession. The rolls on which the fines were recorded provide the earliest systematic evidence of what people and institutions across society wanted from the king and he was prepared to give. They open a large window onto the politics, government, economy and society of England in the hinge period between the establishment of Magna Carta at the start of Henry\u2019s reign and the parliamentary state which was emerging at its end.\r\n\r\nThere is a fine roll for each of Henry III's fifty-six regnal years. Recording offers of money to the king for a multiplicity of concessions and favours, they are of the first importance for the study of political, governmental, legal, social, and economic history. \r\n\r\nThe Henry III Fine Rolls Project, which was funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council between April 2005 and December 2011, makes the rolls available to a wide audience in a summarised and translated form on its website.\r\nThe Fine Rolls of Henry III from 1216 down to 1248 are published in both print and electronic form, including access to digital facsimiles of the rolls.\r\n\r\nThe Project has been funded in two phases by the Arts and Humanities Research Council. The first phase was from April 2005 to March 2008. The second was from April 2008 to December 2011. The project combines the History Department of King\u2019s College London, KCL\u2019s Department of Digital Humanities (DDH) (formerly the Centre for Computing in the Humanities), the History Department of Canterbury Christ Church University (CCCU) and The National Archives (TNA) where the rolls are kept. The project was conceived by Louise Wilkinson (CCCU). The Principal Investigator was David Carpenter (KCL). The Co-investigators were David Crook (TNA), Louise Wilkinson (CCCU), and Harold Short, Director of CCH, who headed the team doing the technical research. The research fellows were Paul Dryburgh and Beth Hartland. The technical team included Paul Spence, Paul Caton, Arianna Ciula, Tamara Lopez and Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vieria. The National Archives Team included Sean Cunningham, Adrian Jobson, Aidan Lawes and Jess Nelson. The Project was supported by two Advisory Groups: an International Advisory Group and a Knowledge Transfer Advisory Group.\r\n\r\n## Resources on CKAN\r\nThe Henry III Fine Rolls CKAN Dataset makes available two major data resources:\r\n\r\n* The set of rolls in TEI-XML format;\r\n* The ontology of entities (persons, places and subjects) out of which the indexes and search available on the project site are generated.\r\n\r\n",

The ontology was based on what at the time of the project initiation were emerging technologies associated with the semantic web 2 (RDF/OWL) and with knowledge representation in the cultural heritage sector (CIDOC CRM).\r\n\r\nThis \u2018ontological\u2019 approach is used to model information about entities referenced as part of the scholarly research, and to incorporate other key standards used for modelling humanities materials, including standards for geospatial, conceptual or time-related data. Detailed information about each entity (e.g. original name of a person versus modernised spellings, patronymic versus tomonymic surname, textual variants) is included in the ontology as well as the expression of complex relationships with other entities. \r\nThis system is the backbone of the rich indexes and search available on the project website but exposed for the first time as part of this Dataset.\r\n\r\nFor information on how the translations of the rolls were encoded following the TEI schema see http://www.finerollshenry3.org.uk/content/commentary/technical.html",

        "notes": "# The Project\r\n\r\nFor much of the later Middle Ages, south-western France (Aquitaine) was under English rule. Every year from 1273 a \u2018Gascon roll\u2019 was drawn up by the English royal administration, recording a wide range of business and mentioning many people and places. The rolls were continued until 1468 even though the area was lost by the English in 1453, and are to be found today in The National Archives at Kew in class C 61. The rolls are almost entirely written in Latin. Some entries are in Anglo-Norman (French), generally forming transcripts of documents recited in entries on the rolls, or copied verbatim in the form of confirmations of documents issued by previous rulers or by officers of the administration in Aquitaine.\r\n\r\nIn 2009 a project began to produce an on-line calendar of the rolls. This was funded by the AHRC and led by Dr Malcolm Vale (Oxford), Dr Paul Booth (Liverpool), and Paul Spence (Department of Digital Humanities, King\u2019s College London). The site currently contains full calendars for the last ten years of the reign of Edward II (1317-27), and for many years of the first half of the  reign of Edward III, produced in this project.\r\n\r\nIn 2012 funding was gained from the Laboratoire d\u2019excellence LaScArBx, the Banque Num\u00e9rique des Savoirs d\u2019Aquitaine, the Ch\u00e2teau Ausone (Saint-\u00c9milion) and Jonathan Sumption. This has enabled the continuation of the project and the development of a parallel French site, coordinated by Professor Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Boutoulle and Emeritus Professor Fran\u00e7oise Lain\u00e9 (Bordeaux) and Paul Spence.\r\n\r\nFunding was awarded by the Leverhulme Trust for a two year project from 1 May 2013, led by Professor Anne Curry (Southampton) and Dr Philip Morgan (Keele), and Paul Spence (King\u2019s College London). It also involved the active collaboration of the Universit\u00e9 Bordeaux Montaigne (formerly Universit\u00e9 Michel de Montaigne-Bordeaux 3) and UMR Ausonius. Research associates Dr Simon Harris and Dr Guilhem P\u00e9pin - the former being helped voluntarily by Nigel Coulton, a skilled palaeographer and Latinist, and the latter by Fran\u00e7oise Lain\u00e9, emeritus professor of the Universit\u00e9 Bordeaux-Montaigne - and a research team based at the Department of Digital Humanities, King\u2019s College London, all involved in the 2009 and 2012 projects, also worked on the Leverhulme project. The project also continue its association with the Ranulf Higden Society, a group of learned individuals whose work editing one of the earlier Gascon Rolls lay in part behind the ideas for the original projects, and whose full editions appear on the website.\r\n\r\n## Resources on CKAN\r\nThe Gascon Rolls CKAN Dataset makes available the following resources:\r\n\r\n* The set of rolls in TEI-XML format;\r\n* An Eatsml file in XML containing the set of entity records  (for persons, places, etc.) out of which the indexes and search available on the project site are generated;\r\n* The project guidelines for encoding the calendared versions of the rolls into TEI-XML.\r\n",
